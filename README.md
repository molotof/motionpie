**motionPie** has been renamed to **motionEyeOS** and lives now at [https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos).

The reasons for renaming the project include:
* preventing the missassociation with the Raspberry PI (motionEyeOS now supports 5 different boards)
* avoiding name confusions generated by all the projects built around *motion*
* pointing out that this is an *operating system* based on and built especially for *motionEye*
* the name *motionPie* simply sucks

The last motionPie version is [20150719](https://github.com/ccrisan/motionpie/releases/tag/20150719) while the first motionEyeOS version is [20151011](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/releases/tag/20151011). The versioning conventions as well as the release and update procedures remain the same.

Updating from motionPie to motionEyeOS however cannot be done automatically - it requires manual downloading and writing of the new image to your SD card, from scratch. The main reasons behind this choice are the new partition layout, the backwards-incompatible motionEye configuration changes and the new download URL.

All the wiki pages have been [updated accordingly](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki).
